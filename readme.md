# MariaDBServerFabricMC 2.0

#### Before version 2.0, I was using the MariaDB4J library to set up and start the database server. Now, I implemented myself the things to install the database server.

#### This mod does nothing special except download, extract and start a MariaDB server

#### For now, only one config is available : you can choose the port that will be use by the database

important: If the server crashes during installation, some files may not have been downloaded/extracted completely. So delete the "database" folder in "config/mariadb_server_fabricmc".
